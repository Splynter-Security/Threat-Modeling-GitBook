# Architectural Threat Identification

How to go about it?
Categories (stride style)
Catalogs (MITRE) -> introduce examples
Overall, less work has been done on architectural threat identification in cyber security.
Whereas modeling notations can leverage previous research in fields of risk management,
specific threat identifying cannot leverage as much previous research.
We propose 2 techniques used in practice.
Both can be changed, the most important end goal of this step is to reach a list of potential threats.
Use models to inform...

Some examples of architectural threats.
Take encryption.
Insert an image here.

Input: Models, research
Output: list of threats
Technique high level: brainstorming
This level: splynter proposed categories linked to paper mention why vulnerabilities are not as useful
Ideally: Catalogs exist at lower levels, making architectural catalogs would be interesting. CAWE Catalog, weaknesses over vulnerabilities.
Actually, just use CAWE as the standard?
A practical technique for generating a list of threats.
Explain it with tactics and weaknesses. Weaknesses are vulnerabilities but not threats.
Threats need to be acted upon however they can used to inform your thinking.

Making such a list can look as follows:

The rest of this chapter will focus on some brainstorming techniques you can use to identify threats.
