# Motivation

## Why
One morning an engineer wakes up to to messages alerting them that their company infrastructure has been compromised.
Not because of flaws in their software or operational practices however, but due to a critical dependency on a different company.
The news quickly finds it way to the executives of the company who ask themselves how such an issue couldn't be identified earlier.
Is there any way to prevent this from happening?
Perhaps a consistent methodology to chart the security landscape of their company, identifying dangers not just on singular servers but also in the supply chain and beyond.
This is the story of many companies involved in the 2019-2020 Solarwinds attacks [[1]](#References).

## What

Identifying dangers to operational infrastructure is far from a recent desire.
Even before the field of cyber security and a company such as Solarwinds even existed it was necessary to chart dangers to physical systems to understand weaknesses to for example theft, war, or even nature natural disasters.
This domain is known as threat modelling.
In a broad sense, threat modelling is something all of us do every day to understand the dangers (or "threats") in our day-to-day life.
As shown in the earlier example, today, this kind of process should also be done by companies to protect and gain a deeper understanding of their own cyber infrastructure.


## How

Threat modelering documentatie wordt best toegepast als een iteratief proces waarin het onderliggend systeem systematisch duidelijker wordt geschetst. Dit zorgt voor een continue risicoanalyse van het onderliggend systeem om toekomstige securityinitiatieven te helpen begeleiden

Lots of work has been done, especially by Microsoft.
