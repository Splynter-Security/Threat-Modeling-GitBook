# Layering

As alluded to in the previous section, threat modeling is an incredibly broad domain.
Even when just restricting the scope to threat modeling cyber infrastructures, 
"what" exactly is the subject of the threat modeling activity is not always clear.

The goal of threat modeling is to be a process of iteratively refining a defined security model.
But what is the subject of this security model?
This is where a proper understanding of "layering" is crucial -- it is necessary to have a framework to think about where threats come from, what they look like and what techniques should be used to elicit them.
It's therefore not just vital to understand how to threat model, but also to understand what kind of threat modeling is useful and when.
