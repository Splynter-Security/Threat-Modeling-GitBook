# Methodology
This section describes an abstract methodology for threat modeling.
Remember threat modeling is a preventive tool.
See threat modeling as a constant instead of 

In general, threat modeling can be modeled as constant a cycle of phase.
This can be seen in Shostack and 
The ideas behind this methodology is cross-layer, being both applicable at the architectural as well as the system layer

```
Modeling -> Identification -> Controls
```

## Modeling
First you want to make a diagram or model of your project.
This should pay special attention to concepts such as threats.

## Identification
After having establish an initial architectural system mode, the phase of threat identification begins.
Note, this does not mean your model will not ever change anymore from this point on, in fact the opposite is true;
once threats (and later controls) start being identified, these can be used to model new elements or specialize existing ones.
The main goal of threat identification is the creation of a list of threats to the modeled system.
The first component of threat modeling consists of identifying and cataloging threats, vulnerabilities, requirements, etc.
Another helpful tool are threat catalogs, these collects threats
After this you can think about controls to those threats
This can be done highly interactively through workshops etc.



There's several of different tools professionals use to aid this identification effort.
Mnemonics, attack trees and attack libraries to name a few.

## Controls
