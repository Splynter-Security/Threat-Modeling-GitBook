# Synthesis

Reaching the end of the course, you should now have a good understanding of threat modeling and how it pertains to the architectural layer. Having explored the foundations of threat modeling; layering and methodology, then applying them in the specific threat modeling activities. By using the techniques outlined in these chapters such as ArchiMate, OSA, and CAPEC you are now ready to start drafting threat modeling documentation on your own.

Remember, the goal of threat modeling is building a continuous risk analysis documentation that assists future security initiatives in identifying what threats to focus on. By identifying the correct layering boundaries and then performing an architectural threat modeling analysis you are more than well on your way to achieve this goal.
