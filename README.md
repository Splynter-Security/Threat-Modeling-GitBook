![](Splynter-cover.jpg)

A GitBook on threat modelling.
This a course developed by [Splynter](https://www.splynter.be/) to aid companies in understanding the fundamentals behind threat modelling.
It explores concepts and techniques on modelling, identification and controlling threats.

The main focus of the course currently is to provide a background in modelling and identification -- the first iterative procedure transition in threat modelling.
The second transition, from threat identification to controlling those threats will be expanded upon in a later version of the course.

Sections will include some references that are directly related to content on that page and there is an extensive reference section at the end of the course for those interested.
