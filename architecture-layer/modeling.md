# Modeling

Architectural Modeling as a discipline has a wealth of literature to probe from.
A natural starting point to find the right modeling language is to thus also look at modeling notations specialized in the architectural layer.
Amongst these, the ideal notation would preferably also have pre-existing security components that could be  leveraged for threat modeling.
A good architectural system model needs to be able to show multi-layer concepts, ideally providing a common abstract language for business and technical analysts to communicate with.
Technology independent and able to integrate with lower level diagrams.
We need to be able to find threats in an architectural sense: design flaws, not simply implementation failures or inter-connectivity issues.
Archimate is such a notation -- an open standard modeling notation specialized in cross-layer modeling.
Built upon a strong theoretical foundation of Togaf and Zachman, it provides a multi-view modeling technique that leverages inter-layer concepts.
Also a Risk and Security overlay has been proposed, providing a toolbox of a diverse array of elements needed for threat modeling activities.
It is widely used in practice, easing adoption as a threat modeling standard is simplified providing business.
