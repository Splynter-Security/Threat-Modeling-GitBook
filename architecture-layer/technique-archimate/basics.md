# Basics

The intention of this chapter is not to give a complete introduction to Archimate.
It is assumed that at least some background is already present.
If this is not the case, please refer to the Archimate specification for more information. [[1]](#references)
Instead, this chapter will highlight the core concepts and notations used in Archimate that are of interest to be extended for threat modeling.

## Layers

One of the most distinctive elements of the Archimate notation is its clear separation into different layers that can be easily mapped on TOGAF or Zachman layers.
As stated before, archimate is...
The main draw of Archimate is its clear separation of layers.
There are 3 main layers:
There is however also a fourth layer which is usually used less than the other 3, namely the motivation layer...

## Motivation Layer

The motivation layer, also sometimes referred to as the strategic layer, enables analysts to model elements related to goals, outcomes, principles and requirements.
This will be especially relevant for risk management since this often is focused on core concepts surrounding requirements and security objectives.

## Overlays and Extensions

Another important concept of Archimate is its ability to be extended with overlays and extensions.
An overlay is xyz.
An extension is xys
Overlays and extensions allow for reuse of the core Archimate specification in contexts that need a bit more refinement of its general purpose layer.

## Domains

The final concept of interest is the idea of domains. 
A domain is xyz.
This of special interest for security modelling because it maps closely to the idea of a "security domain".
Where components are grouped with similar security requirements and permissions.
Do note that this has applications for threat modeling in zero-trust architectures. [[2]](#references)
