# Technique: OSA

OSA, open security architecture is an old framework.
It is however important
Typically threat actors are not an explicit step in the threat identification, at best modeling
however refinement is useful and a natural part of the identification step.
Also threat actors help inform threat identification and classification.

## The OSA model
![OSA Model](OSA.jpg)

OSA can be modeled as 3 orthogonal dimensions...
These dimensions are.
Threat actors fit into.
Considering .


## Conclusion
Threat actors also help to brainstorm
But more important for model refinement. 
Specializing previously made threat agents.
Threat agents will be particularly import when judging impact and feasibility of threats in threat identification
