# Architectural Threat Identification

How to go about it?
Categories (stride style)
Catalogs (MITRE) -> introduce examples
Overall, less work has been done on architectural threat identification in cyber security.
Whereas modeling notations can leverage previous research in fields of risk management,
specific threat identifying cannot leverage as much previous research.
We propose 2 techniques used in practice.
Both can be changed, the most important end goal of this step is to reach a list of potential threats.
Use models to inform...

Some examples of architectural threats.
Take encryption.
Insert an image here.

Input: Models, research
Output: list of threats
Technique high level: brainstorming
This level: splynter proposed categories linked to paper mention why vulnerabilities are not as useful
Ideally: Catalogs exist at lower levels, making architectural catalogs would be interesting. CAWE Catalog, weaknesses over vulnerabilities.
Actually, just use CAWE as the standard?
A practical technique for generating a list of threats.
Explain it with tactics and weaknesses. Weaknesses are vulnerabilities but not threats.
Threats need to be acted upon however they can used to inform your thinking.

Making such a list can look as follows:

The rest of this chapter will focus on some brainstorming techniques you can use to identify threats.

Catalogs can be found externally or attempted to be identified and created internally.
One often pitfall in building architectural catalogs is confusing threats with vulnerabilities.
# Categories
Brainstorming?

Take a mnemonics or a list of categories and use these to find specific threats.
link to paper.

After having establish an initial architectural system mode, the phase of threat identification begins.
Note, this does not mean your model will not ever change anymore from this point on, in fact the opposite is true;
once threats (and later controls) start being identified, these can be used to model new elements or specialize existing ones.
The main goal of threat identification is the creation of a list of threats to the modeled system.
--> move most of this to the methodology section
In a way, the input for this step is a model and the output is catalogued list of threats.
The threats in this...
Expand on architectural threats...

Of course, this begs the question: how can architectural threat identification be done in practice?
Identification is largely a brainstorming step.
As mentioned earlier there exist several brainstorming techniques
In what follows a systematic brainstorming approach based on threat catalogs will be explained.
Using the popular MITRE CAPEC catalog.
